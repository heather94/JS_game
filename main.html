        <p>Please pick a number between 1-1000 inclusive. If you pick a decimal value then the computer will round it up to the nearest interger
            The computer will then try to guess the number. With each guess, the computer will be told if the number you have picked is higher or lower.
            If the computer takes more than 5 guesses to get the value, you win. If the computer takes 5 guesses or lower to get the value, the computer wins.
